# NCL-SPRING-2025-TEAM
Code that i used during the NCL SPRING 2025 team competition

The Untitled 12 file that was created using google colab is python versions of the enssential function from Enum Medium, along with a script to reverse engineer the encoding. 
The last character is wrong in the reverse engineer because it is a single byte and not a four0byte chunk. Should get you close enough, the last original byte is 7.
The version of the decoder that takes 13 is to match the original function from the problem. The 12 character version I just edited so that I could confirm the first twelve digits were correct.
