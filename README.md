# NCL-SPRING-2025-TEAM
Code that i used during the NCL SPRING 2025 team competition

The Untitled 12 file that was created using google colab is python versions of the enssential function from Enum Medium, along with a script to reverse engineer the encoding. 
The last character is wrong in the reverse engineer because it is a single byte and not a four0byte chunk. Should get you close enough, the last original byte is 7.
